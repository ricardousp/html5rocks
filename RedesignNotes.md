# Content #

  * The 'Mobile' feature stack has become a page (one of three major pages featured on the homepage, along with 'Enterprise' and 'Games').
  * 'Connectivity' and 'Semantics' and 'Nuts and Bolts' feature stacks are new, and will pull in content like the other feature stacks.
  * 'Slides', 'Playground', and 'Studio' are going away and their content is being rolled into the appropriate content areas.
  * Content from the footer will moved onto the 'Resources' page as necessary, as will the notes about Chrome Frame and the website being an open source project.

# Code #

  * Minimize the amount of init scrips that happen when we load in content to prevent delays.
  * Using CSS transforms instead of scrolling.
